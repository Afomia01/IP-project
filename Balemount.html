        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>Bale Mountains National Park is located in southeastern Ethiopia, 400 km southeast of Addis Ababa 
        and 150 km east of Shashamene in the Oromia Region National State.[3] The boundary of the BMNP lies within five woredas (districts): 
        Adaba (west), Dinsho (north), Goba (northeast), Delo-Mena-Angetu and Harena-Buluk (southeast). The park area is encompassed within 
        geographical coordinates of 6º29' – 7º10'N and 39º28' – 39º57'E. The Bale Mountains are part of the Bale-Arsi massif, which forms the western section of the southeastern Ethiopian Highlands.

             in the Gaysay Valley average daytime temperatures are around 20 °C (68 °F), and the Harenna Forest is around 25 °C (77 °F).

        <h2>Flora</h2>
        <p>
            The forests of the Bale Mountains are important for genetic stocks of wild forest coffee (Coffea arabica) and for medicinal plants in Ethiopia. 
            Three medicinal plant hotspots have been identified: two in the Gaysay area and one in the Angesu area, spanning the park boundary. 
            The female flowers of hagenia contain anthelmintic, which is used to treat tapeworms among the local populations
