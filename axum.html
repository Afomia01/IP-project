        <p>As the home to the Queen of Sheba and (as the story goes) the Ark of the Covenant, the storied artefact of Moses’ 10 commandments Axum is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in northern African, dating back to 400 BC.<br><br>
            A quick trip to the north of the city reveals the Stelae field of various monuments that were carved and erected in the 4th century, known as the <strong>Obelisks of Axum</strong>. The proud pillars, each over 1,700 years old, 24 meters tall, made of solid granite and some weighing over 160 tons, are impressive sights to behold.<br><br>
            In the same area, researchers have uncovered a number of tombs in Axum since the 1970s, but sadly many had been plundered by tomb raiders and only one such grave, The Tomb of the False Door, is now open to visitors. <br><br>

        <p>Situated in the Maekelay Zone of the Tigray Region, near the base of the Adwa mountains, Axum is known for its huge obelisks that tower over the centre of town, the tallest being over 33 metres. Dating back 1,700 years, these obelisks are the remnants of a once dominant Axumite empire. </p><br>

        <p>The <i>Italian</i> occupation of Ethiopia is considered by many a period of hardship within the country, with many long hidden artefacts and national treasures being stolen by the occupiers, and despite its mammoth measurements, the Monolith of Axum was taken from Ethiopians in the 1930s. <br><br>
            Found, semi-submerged in a pit by a group of Italian soldiers in 1935, the Obelisk was removed from its home, partially dismantled, and after over two years in limbo, was transported to Rome as a spoil of war. <br>
            It was re-erected in Portal Capena square, in front of the Ministry for Italian Relations in Africa, a somewhat ironic end to this stolen spoil of war. <br><br>

        Now back in home, towering over the smaller Obelisks that encircle it, this graphite monolith is one of Axum’s key attractions. <br><br>
        The obelisk features two ornamented false doors, with layers of varying designs and decorating slithering up the tower, around rows of false windows, to the semi-circular domed top. <br><br>
        The detailing on these decorations is so precise that the windows and doors all have locks carved into them, and every inch on the Stelae shows levels of artistry and craftsmanship not seen for many years after its construction. <br><br>
        The graphite used in the construction is believed to have come from a quarry several miles south of the city, and the level of organization and infrastructure needed to facilitate a project of this calibre demonstrates a level of social organization and technology previously thought impossible for the time. <br><br>
