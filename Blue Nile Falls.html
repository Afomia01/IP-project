        The Blue Nile Falls is a waterfall on the Blue Nile river in West Gojjam, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. It is known as Tis Abay in Amharic, meaning 'Smoke Abay'. It is situated on the upper course of the river, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) downstream from the town of Bahir Dar and Lake Tana. The falls are one of Ethiopia's best-known tourist attractions.

     <h2>Reasons to visit the Blue Nile Falls</h2> <h3>1.The Falls</h3>
     <p>The Blue Nile river, which emanates from the nearby Lake Tana, cascades down a 42m-high drop to produce a dazzling spray of mist and rainbows. In the rainy season, when the falls are at their strongest, it's easy to see why the locals call it 'Tis Abay' meaning ‘the Great Smoke’ in Amharic. </p>
