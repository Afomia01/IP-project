        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Simien Mountains National Park is the largest national park in Ethiopia. Located in the North Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, its territory covers the highest
          parts of the Simien Mountains and includes Ras Dashan, the highest point in Ethiopia.<br> <br>  
    
        The national park was one of the first sites to be made a World Heritage Site by <abbr title="United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr>, inscribed in 1978 because of its outstanding biodiversity and spectacular landscape.
        Due to serious population declines of some of its characteristic native species, in 1996 it was added to the <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/" targt="blank">List of World Heritage in Danger</a>. With the stabilization of those species' populations, this listing was removed in 2017

            <p>This place is an exotic setting with unique wildlife and breath-taking views on a landscape shaped by nature and traditional agriculture.
                The natural beauties of this region have always filled visitors from Ethiopia and abroad with awe. <br><br>Gentle highland ridges at altitudes above 3600 meters above sea level (m asl), covered with grasses, isolated trees (Erica &bored) and the bizarre Giant Lobelia (Lobelia rhynchopetalum) are found on the high plateau that ends abruptly at 1000- to 2000-m deep escarpments.<br>
